# TapGame

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.2.

## Overview

**Tap Game** is an engaging and addictive Angular-based game where players test their reflexes by tapping on blue dots among a group of red dots. The game starts simple but becomes increasingly challenging as the levels progress. The objective is to tap a required number of blue dots within a given time to pass each level.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Simple and fun tap-based game mechanics.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As players advance through the levels, the number of required blue dots to tap increases, and so does the time limit.
- **Level-Based System**: Each new level increases the challenge, providing an engaging experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
